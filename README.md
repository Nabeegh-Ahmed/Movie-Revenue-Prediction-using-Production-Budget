# Movie Revenue Prediction based on Production Budget

This is a very simplistic implementation of <b>Linear Regression</b>. Use <a href="https://machinelearningmastery.com/linear-regression-for-machine-learning/">this link</a> to read more about how Linear Regression works.

# Working
This model uses Pandas DataFrame data structure to load data from a CSV file. This data set is provided by <a href="https://www.the-numbers.com/movie/budgets">The Numbers</a>. The data was obtained and cleansed, removing some potentially bad data entries. A scatter plot of the data was then obtained using <b>matplotlib</b>. A Regression equation was first obtained using <b>scikit learn</b> and it was then plotted on to the scatter plot obtained before. This equation and the plot can be used to predict how much revenue a movie will generate based on the budget.

# Final Notes
Please note that this a very simple model. It was meant for starting learning Data Science and Machine Learning. I aim to learn more Data Science concepts and integrate the learned skills with real life applications.
